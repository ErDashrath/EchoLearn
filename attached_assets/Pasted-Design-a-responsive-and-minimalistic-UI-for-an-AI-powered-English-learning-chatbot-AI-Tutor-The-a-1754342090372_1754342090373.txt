Design a responsive and minimalistic UI for an AI-powered English learning chatbot (Your Therapist). The app should support voice and text input, give real-time grammar suggestions, and simulate interviews or roleplay.

👤 User Types:
- Guest (anonymous usage)
- Logged-in user (optional, future-ready)

🧱 Layout:
- Fullscreen, single-page responsive layout
- Sticky top bar: App name/logo, mic toggle, dark/light mode
- Center: Main chat area
- Bottom: Input controls and feedback tools
- Right (optional): Slide-in panel for settings, roles, learning progress

🎨 Theme:
- Minimalist
- Clean typography (Inter or DM Sans)
- Soft shadows, rounded corners (2xl)
- Muted pastel colors (white, gray-50, blue-100, etc.)
- Adaptive to light/dark mode

🧠 Core Features:
- 🔊 Voice input with waveform animation
- 🧑‍🏫 Roleplay / Interview Mode toggle (dropdown or segmented control)
- 💬 Real-time transcript display
- ✍️ On-the-fly grammar suggestion (small tooltip + underline error words)
- 💡 AI feedback summary after each answer (tiny card appears below message)
- 📤 Upload or paste prompts (e.g., “Tell me about yourself”)
- 🕹️ Adjustable speaking speed (slider)
- 🔁 Regenerate / Retry answer button
- 🧾 Save/export chat (txt, markdown, or json)
- 🎯 Toggle for “Fluency Focus” vs “Correction Focus”
- 🔔 Non-intrusive notification/feedback (toast at corner)

📱 Responsiveness:
- Mobile-first design
- On mobile: bottom input bar fixed with floating mic button
- Chat bubbles use entire width for readability
- Voice controls slide up as needed

🔁 Optional Components:
- 📊 Progress Tracker (based on number of corrections over time)
- 🧩 Side widget: “Try a prompt” (random interview or conversation starters)
- 🌍 Language selector or accents to simulate regional interviews

💡 Interaction UX:
- Typing animation for AI response
- Fade-in cards for feedback
- Subtle haptic/micro-animation on button press (using Framer Motion)
- Smooth auto-scroll during conversation
- Scrollback resume (return to latest message smoothly)

⚠️ Limitations to Avoid (vs typical tools like Duolingo, ChatGPT):
- Don’t hide user feedback in menus — show it clearly below messages
- Don’t use cramped text areas — always give comfortable reading space
- Avoid splitting UI into unrelated panels; keep it centered and cohesive
- Ensure everything fits cleanly into the viewport (no awkward scrolls or floating components)
- Enable mic toggle and feedback without page reloads or resets

🏗️ Tech-ready: Vite + Vanilla / React compatible layout

Generate the layout with clean components and utility-based CSS (Tailwind or similar). Make it dev-ready for integration with Ollama (LLM) and Web Speech API (voice).
