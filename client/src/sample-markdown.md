### Lists and Formatting

### Code Blocks with Copy Button

Here's a JavaScript example:

  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to Mindscribe.`);
  
  // AI-powered English learning
  const suggestions = analyzeGrammar(name);
  return suggestions;
}

// Usage example
greetLearner("Student");
```

### Python Example

```python
def practice_english():
    """
    Practice English with AI assistance
    """
    topics = [
        "Grammar correction",
        "Vocabulary building", 
        "Conversation practice"
    ]
    
    for topic in topics:
        print(f"Learning: {topic}")
    
    return "Keep practicing!"

# Start learning
